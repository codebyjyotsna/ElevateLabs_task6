# Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
This repository contains a project focused on understanding and implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification tasks, using the popular Mall Customer Segmentation dataset.

## üìä Project Overview
The objective of this task is to explore how KNN and clustering techniques can be applied to real-world data‚Äîin this case, segmenting mall customers based on their demographics and spending patterns. The notebook `KNN.ipynb` walks through the entire process, from data exploration and visualization to clustering with K-Means and an introduction to classification with KNN.

## üìù Dataset
- **Filename:** `Mall_Customers.csv`
- **Description:** Contains 200 records of mall customers with the following features:
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
  - `Gender`: Male/Female
  - `Age`: Age of the customer
  - `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income in thousands of dollars
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning algorithms (KMeans clustering, KNN, silhouette score)
- **Plotly:** Interactive visualizations (optional)
